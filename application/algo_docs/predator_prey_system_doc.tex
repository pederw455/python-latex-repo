\section{Predator-Prey System}

\subsection{Introduction}

The predator-prey system is a set of differential equations known as the Lotka-Volterra equations, which describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact: a prey and a predator.

\subsection{Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $p_{\text{prey}}$: Population of prey at time $t$.
    \item $p_{\text{predator}}$: Population of predators at time $t$.
    \item $t$: Time variable.
    \item $\alpha$: Growth rate of the prey.
    \item $\beta$: Rate at which predators consume prey.
    \item $\delta$: Growth rate of predators due to consumption of prey.
    \item $\gamma$: Natural death rate of predators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formulas}

\begin{align*}
    \frac{dp_{\text{prey}}}{dt} &= \alpha p_{\text{prey}} - \beta p_{\text{prey}} p_{\text{predator}} \\
    \frac{dp_{\text{predator}}}{dt} &= \delta p_{\text{prey}} p_{\text{predator}} - \gamma p_{\text{predator}}
\end{align*}
